## Overview
TrackFlow is a bug tracking app created using FastAPI + React. It is an open-source solution for people looking for a free and lightweight solution.

### Technologies used
- Python
- FastAPI
- PostgresSQL
- React
- Tailwind


## Installation
Install the frontend and backend dependencies once:

```
git clone https://github.com/DarshanVaishya/TrackFlow
cd TrackFlow/client
npm install
cd ../server
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the whole app from the project root with one command:

```
.\start-trackflow.bat
```

This starts the frontend on http://127.0.0.1:5173 and the backend on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

If you prefer to run them separately, use two terminals.

Terminal 1
```
cd TrackFlow/client
npm run dev
```
This will start your front-end server on http://localhost:5173

Terminal 2
```
cd TrackFlow/server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
This will start your back-end sever on http://localhost:8000
